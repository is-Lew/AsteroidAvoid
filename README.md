About
=====
A browser game where you are an alien hurtling through an asteroid field, if you crash it's **Game Over!!**
Use the arrow keys to navigate the window and **avoid** those **asteroids** 
This game was created as part of my development into a software engineering. It is built using only HTML,
SCSS and JavaScript.
